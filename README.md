🌌 Solar System VR (A-Frame)

This project is an interactive VR model of the Solar System built with A-Frame
. It provides a simple yet immersive way to explore the Sun and planets inside a web browser or VR headset.

🚀 Features

Realistic planetary arrangement
Planets are positioned along the X-axis with approximate relative distances.

Rotating celestial bodies
Each planet (and the Sun) spins on its own axis using A-Frame animations.

Glowing Sun
The Sun is emissive and acts as a point light, illuminating the planets.

High-quality textures
Each planet uses an image texture (.jpeg) mapped onto a sphere.

VR-ready
Works directly in the browser; supports WebXR for VR devices (Oculus, Vive, etc.).

🛠️ Technologies Used

A-Frame 1.2.0 (WebVR / WebXR framework built on top of Three.js)

HTML5 + JavaScript for structure and interactivity

Planet texture images for realistic rendering
🌍 Future Enhancements

Orbital motion (planets revolving around the Sun).

Moon orbiting Earth.

Scaling distances & sizes closer to real-world ratios.

Add VR controls for navigation.
